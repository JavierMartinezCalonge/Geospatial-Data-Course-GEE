I want to thank Qiusheng Wu and the United Nations University for the amazing course in Spatial Data Management with Google Earth Engine. I highly recommended to all of the people interested in GIS and environmental applications using Python and AI tools. 
This is just a personal repository with some of the insights and own projects from the course of the UN University for the Spatial Data Management using Python and Google Earth Engine.
